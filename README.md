# Encode Solana Autumn Bootcamp Homework Repository

This repository contains my homework assignments for the [Solana Autumn Bootcamp](https://www.encode.club/solana-autumn-bootcamp).

## Directory Structure ðŸ“‚

The repository is organized into folders by week (`week1`, `week2`, etc.). Each week's folder contains sub-folders for individual homework assignments. Some assignments may include Rust projects with standard Rust project files (`Cargo.lock`, `Cargo.toml`, `src`).

```
