Question: What a decentralised version of a game like monopoly would be like, if
there was no software on a central server.
Answer: Essential Functionality:
    1. Authentication: Secure login possibly via SSI.
    2. Asset Ownership: Represented as NFTs.
    3. Transactions: Buying, trading, paying rent via smart contracts.
    4. Randomness: Fair dice rolls.
    5. Real-time Game State: Tracked on a blockchain.

How to Cheat:
    1. Smart Contract Exploits: Like reentrancy attacks.
    2. Identity Manipulation: Multiple accounts.
    3. Game Logic Bugs: Exploiting flaws.
    4. Unauthorized Transactions: Breaking rules.

 Preventing Cheating:
    1. Smart Contract Auditing: For secure code.
    2. Transparency: Public ledger for all transactions.
    3. Penalties: For proven cheating.
    4. Security: NFT-based authentication

Question: Do you feel that Central Bank Digital Currencies (CBDCs) are a move towards
decentralisation? Will they help or hinder adoption of other cryptocurrencies?
Answer: CBDCs are not a move towards decentralization. They are generally centralized
digital versions of fiat currencies, controlled by central banks.
Even if technologies like Hyperledger or other forms of DLT are used, these are often permissioned and not interoperable with open, decentralized networks.

Impact on Cryptocurrency Adoption:
Help:
    1. Mainstreaming Digital Assets: CBDCs could normalize the use of digital currencies.
    2. Potential for Infrastructure Overlap: Technologies used could be adaptable for other cryptocurrencies.

Hinder:
    1. Regulatory Stranglehold: CBDCs might be accompanied by stringent regulations that stifle crypto innovation.
    2. Centralized Control: The centralization aspect of CBDCs contradicts the ethos of decentralization in cryptocurrencies.

So, CBDCs present both opportunities and challenges for the broader adoption of cryptocurrencies.
